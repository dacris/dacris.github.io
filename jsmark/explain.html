  <h1>Browser Tests Explained</h1>
<h2>CPU Test (Modern)</h2>
<p>This is the test you most definitely want to run. It tests common operations like string manipulation and the merging and comparing of arrays. This is, apart from rendering, is the most common task of JavaScript code inside a web browser. Modern CPUs should be equipped to run this at reasonable speed.</p>
<h2>CPU Test (Classic)</h2>
<p>How does your browser do when it comes to really complex operations like square root, sine, cosine, and exponential functions? This is what this test does. This is what used to be tested in old benchmarks like Whetstone back in the 1980s on CPUs like the legendary 386. When performance was really low, math operations were really important. Nowadays, all CPUs perform these operations very fast and they don't matter as much. It's still useful to look at it from a historical perspective.</p>
